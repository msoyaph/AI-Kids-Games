# Light Crossing — developer notes

Cozy island life-sim in the browser. Vite + TypeScript (strict) + Three.js, built into ONE self-contained
`dist/index.html` (vite-plugin-singlefile). No external assets: all art is procedural low-poly geometry,
all audio is Web Audio synthesis, no web fonts, no network requests.

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — dev server (port from `$PORT`, default 5173). `.claude/launch.json` has `dev` / `preview`.
- `npm run build` — produces `dist/index.html` (single file, works from `file://` and sandboxed iframes).
- `npm test` — vitest unit tests (`tests/*.test.ts`).
- `npm run typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit` (TypeScript 7 native compiler).
- `npm run e2e` — Playwright smoke test (`e2e/`), runs against `vite preview` of the built file.
- `npm run pacing` — pacing simulation (`scripts/pacing.ts`) estimating minutes per chapter.

## Architecture (logic decoupled from rendering)
- `src/core/` — seeded RNG (`Rng`, `hashInts`, `dayRng`), value noise, typed `EventBus`, math helpers.
- `src/world/` — `worldgen.ts` pure deterministic island generator (template + noise + validation/retry),
  `types.ts` (tile enums, regions, `LEVEL_HEIGHT` visual scale).
- `src/sim/` — no DOM / no three. `GameState` (`state.ts`) is plain JSON; `World` (`world.ts`) is the runtime
  view (gen terrain + state objects/structures, collision `blocked(from,to)` incl. ramps/bridges);
  `Game` (`game.ts`) owns state + bus, steps clock/player and registered day/update hooks.
  Systems are modules of functions over `Game`.
- `src/render/` — three.js only reads state + listens to bus. `curve.ts` patches every material's
  `project_vertex` for the rolling-world bend (world-space lighting/shadows unaffected).
  Terrain = 16x16 chunk meshes; objects = `InstancedLayer`s rebuilt when `objectsChanged` fires.
- `src/input/` — keyboard/mouse, Gamepad API, touch → `InputFrame` (axes + `Command[]`).
- `src/ui/` — DOM overlay (vanilla, `h()` helper), styles.css with system rounded fonts.
- `src/data/` — all content as typed data (fish, bugs, fossils, items, recipes, villagers, dialogue,
  missions, challenges, achievements). Adding content = adding data.

## World layout
80x80 tiles. North = -z (top of screen). Levels 0/1/2 (plateau + summit with lighthouse).
Pond carved into cliff base → river south to sea with an eastward fork → lowland regions
West (start, plaza/hall/shop/museum/home lots, dock), NE, SE. Regions only connect via bridges/ramps/ladder.

## Conventions
- Facing angle f: direction = (sin f, cos f) in (x,z); f=0 faces south/camera.
- Tile index i = z*80 + x. Objects: `state.world.objects[i]`, one per tile.
- Structures footprints block tiles except dock/bridge/ramp (walkable).

## Status
- Phase 1 done: scaffold, single-file build, worldgen, terrain/water/vegetation, curved world, camera,
  player movement + collision, clock + day/night lighting.
